# Tildagon Bar App

> I've only tested this on a simulator so far, so not sure if it works on real hardware yet!

A [Tildagon Badge](https://tildagon.badge.emfcamp.org/) app for browsing drinks available at the bars at [EMF](https://emfcamp.org).

This is a work in progress and contributions are more than welcome!

## Development

Start a local fake API:

```python
cd fake_api
python -m http.server
```
