# Tildagon Bar App

> This is a work in progress and doesn't work very well yet. I've only tested this on a simulator so far, so not sure if it works on real hardware yet!

A [Tildagon Badge](https://tildagon.badge.emfcamp.org/) app for browsing drinks available and their stock level at [EMF](https://emfcamp.org) bars.

## Todo

- [ ] Implement bar switching
- [ ] Make the drink details screen look nicer (perhaps not a menu)
- [ ] Cache data to a file for faster loading
- [ ] Show more info on the drink selection menu?

## Development

The live development API didn't work for me, so here's a _very_ simple mock API to work with:

```python
cd fake_api
python -m http.server
```
